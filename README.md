# Wine Quality Prediction

## Introduction
* The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e5/data?select=sample_submission.csv).
* Wine is enjoyed by an increasing number of consumers, making wine certification and quality assessment crucial for safeguarding human health. Certification ensures that wine meets quality standards, preventing illegal adulteration and maintaining market integrity. Quality assessment, often part of the certification process, helps improve winemaking techniques and classify wines into different categories, such as premium brands.
* Wine certification is typically conducted through:
  - **Physicochemical laboratory tests**, which measure factors such as density, alcohol concentration, and pH.
  - **Sensory testing**, which relies on human experts to evaluate taste and aroma.
* Since taste is one of the most challenging human senses to quantify and analyze, this study focuses on using physicochemical data to predict wine quality using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this study are:
1. **Visualizing** the statistical information of the wine dataset.
2. **Analyzing** the probability distribution of different attributes.
3. **Representing** the distribution of numerical and continuous data.
4. **Determining** the most and least important features contributing to wine quality by leveraging the use of machine learning techniques.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of **12 attributes** and **2,056 observations**. Below is a description of each feature:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Fixed Acidity** | The amount of non-volatile acid in the wine. |
| **Volatile Acidity** | The amount of volatile acid that can evaporate. |
| **Citric Acid** | A weak organic acid found naturally in wine. |
| **Residual Sugar** | The remaining sugar after fermentation. |
| **Chlorides** | The salt content in the wine. |
| **Free Sulfur Dioxide** | The amount of unbound sulfur dioxide that protects the wine from spoilage. |
| **Total Sulfur Dioxide** | The total sulfur dioxide present in the wine. |
| **Density** | The wine's mass per unit volume. |
| **pH** | The acidity or alkalinity level of the wine. |
| **Sulphates** | The amount of sulphates, which help protect against oxidation and bacterial contamination. |
| **Alcohol** | The percentage of alcohol in the wine. |
| **Quality** | A sensory quality score, typically ranging from 3 to 8. |
